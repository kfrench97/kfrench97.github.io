The exciting part about this blog is that I get to do this with my children. I love food, and I love to share experiences and talk
 about them with my kids. 

We decided to contribute to a blog together to document our adventures and share these experiences with others. We all plan on
 contributing, so look for posts from Dad (Kevin), Daughter (Annelise) and Son (Steven). Mom (Nicole) is around, and she may pop in here from 
time to time, but this is a project for Dad and the kids.   

A final note about this blog is the framework it is written on. I, Dad, wanted something technical I could manage versus the 
standard "templates" one gets from the established "brand", so please bear with us as I learn and grown and the site changes to 
represent that!

Thank you for checking in and we hope that you will visit often and provide us with many comments on our posts!
